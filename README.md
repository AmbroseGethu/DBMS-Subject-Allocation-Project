## Creating a New Branch üõ†

:one: Always keep updating your master branch with the main repository by running the following command on the local master branch. Here the default master branch is the main branch.
```bash
git pull upstream main
```

:two: Always create a new branch before making any changes. Never ever make any changes directly on the master branch. To create a **new** branch,

```bash
git checkout -b '<new-branch-name>'
```
